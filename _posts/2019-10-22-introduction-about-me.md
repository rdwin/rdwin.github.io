Hello, strangers (_If there were any_). Never expected anyone would be willing to open this website other than myself.

Now that you opened this page, let me properly introduce myself. I am __Dwi Nur R.__.

In real life, I see myself as an introverted person. Like most people assume of an introvert person, meeting a lot of people and being open to conversations aren't exactly my strong suit. I prefer to absorb my surroundings, like observing and analyzing others, rather than act out without an understanding of the situation. On some occasions, I also could be talk-active, especially to topics I'm into or to someone I'm familiar with.

I like to do both indoor and outdoor activities. My favorite way to get outside is motoride. Visiting new places and capturing its moments is something that I enjoy the most. I never get bored by the new sceneries I found while riding.\
I am also interested in comics and podcasts. I feel excited about the new updates. When I caught up, I had a habit to binge both new comics and podcasts in my free time. So, feel free to recommend new comics and podcasts that are worth seeing.

I’ve never actually written an article other than school’s assignment. I’m not sure if I am talented in writing, storytelling, and making stories. Even so, I will give it a try. I am always eager to learn new things and writing is one of many skills that I wanted to learn.

I hope you enjoy my articles!
