It’s been a year since I struggled with my undergraduate’s thesis. I’ve been troubled with either related to theory I’d used or procedural issues when doing academic administration. Both issues took me longer than I anticipated in the writing process. 

> Trust me, You'll get your turn eventually. You don't need to compare yourself to your friends. Everyone has their own turn to be successful.

I found this quote while searching for tips and tricks on writing a thesis. When I look for its comments, it always has a positive reaction, everyone seems to be motivated by this quote and sharing their own experience.

Mistakes and failures could build up your strength to face other adversity when the next events occurred. The motive behind it was to become more resilient in overcoming adversity.

> What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.
*~Friedrich Nietzsche*{: .auth}

There are several conditions needed to confirm that these phrases can work to encourage someone, such as having support, either social support or faith in god, resources, and the most important thing is a strong mentality.\
Without those things, there is no guarantee that one will stay positive in their misfortune. The hope and expectation of being stronger and successful could actually make you more vulnerable in facing failure.

_“What doesn't kill you, makes you traumatized”_ is more fit in this kind of situation.

In my situation, I got the same type of motivational phrase from my colleague. With or without it, I still struggled alone and tried to solve my problem with my own effort. So, what’s the difference between sharing it if I do anything alone anyway?\
I found out that it feels *__insincere__* to send this to someone who’s struggling. I mean… It only took a second to type or even google this quote. Unless you were someone special, this is just an empty word from someone who doesn’t want to help.

So please, if you really want to help get your hand dirty and help the one in need. Don’t use these quotes as an excuse.
