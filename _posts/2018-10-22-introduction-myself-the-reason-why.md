### Introduction

Hello, strangers (*If there were any*). Never expected anyone would willing to open this website other than myself.

Now that you opened this page, let me properly introduce myself. I am **Dwi Nur Rohmad**, I usually goes with Dwi or Rohmad, or any nickname you can come up with, I didn't really care. I graduated from UGM in psychology major after 5 years of study. It isn't one that I proud of, actually. But a degree is still a degree no matter how long you got it, right?

In real life, I see myself as an introvert person. Like most people assumes on introvert person, meeting a lot of people and being  talk-active aren't exactly my strong suit. But it doesn't necessarily mean that I am a anti-social and psychopathic person. I prefer to absorb my surroundings, like observing and listening to others, rather than act out without an understanding of the situation. In some occasion, I also could talking too much without realizing, especially to a topics I'm interested in or someone I'm familiar with. I like to invest my time in myself only. I used to do most of the things alone. By the time tried to not get help, I learned a lot of skill, including self control for properly doing my job and time management.

### Reason why

In general, I'm not the kind of person who will leave a big impression on someone. In fact, I felt like I often leaves a bad impression, like being expressionless in most situations. Yeah... I'm not really good at controling my facial expressions, so they might see me as a boring person to communicate with. This trait makes me feels like I am invisible in most events I got in. Although I always did my job perfectly, unfortunately there were not much of people seems to notice me. Maybe they saw me as not an important figure, or I was being used as a stepping stone their own success, or because my incapability in social relationships. I'm not so sure about that. I believed there were several other reason why I am invisible.

*If you do your job very competently, you might expect that your boss should notice that.*

*But the problem with doing things well, is that it's invisible. What's visible is mistakes. So then you just work really hard and you're invisible. That's not helpfull
It's work. It's a strategy. It's a war to do that but you can do it.*

*Well, the first thing we do is.. are you actually doing a good job? let's say yes, then are you documenting it? Generally no, If so, Are you communicating the documentation?*

I randomly found those words in YouTube Short. It was said by Jordan Peterson in some podcast. Well, I completely agree with it. I realize that, up until now I documenting other's great job, but I never records my own, let alone communicating it to other. While I always did what I had to do properly, depend on the job descriptions and the procedures, I rarely do something else other than that. I always expects other would notice me and I feel proud of having them without knowing that is not helpful at all in improving my personal branding. The very reason I made this website was to satisfy those expectations by compile all projects, ideas, opinions, and also stories in one place. So, I can easily show off my works to other.

Writing isn't my kind of things. In fact, I hate it. I had a lot of things in my mind. I felt like I could talk for two hours straight, but when I put it in some structural word, I would get a random text that doesn't make sense nor have a connection what-so-ever. I hate the fact that I couldn't put my thoughts into words. In most cases, I needed to reviewed my writings at least thrice in order to understand the emotion I had when I wrote those words. So inconvenient, right?

Through this project, I can practice my writing skill. I don't have to worry about how much time I wasted, because right now, I had a lot of free time. Yeah... I didn't have job yet. I could learn some skill related to the job I interested in. But, I hit the wall of being incapable on gaining practical experiences in that area. The knowledge I'm hoping for only could be gain in real time job, so I can't do anything about it. I'm hoping that I could fill my free time with new habit. Though I also didn't have any experience in writing, it is much more simpler than learn a knowledge that I can't relate in any way.

### End

I did this project around early 2023. I need around 3 months or so, to wrote all articles and re-wrote all my projects from 2020 to 2022. So the dates aren't exactly the same as when I wrote the articles. But I do know the months and years when I actually experienced it.

All projects and articles in this website are written in English. There were some netizen said, "When the talk is deep or too personal, people tend to use English than Bahasa". To certain point, I agree. Also, I have idea why this is happened. Either to make the actual problem more complicated or force of a habits created by western culture or the need to be seen as an intellectual person. The latter is the best, ngl. 

Lastly, I learned English through read comics, watch movies and watch stand up comedy. You might find my articles used common vocabularies and messed up grammar. So... Forgive me about that. 

### Notes

This website contains two things. My project documentations and some articles.

I wrote almost every articles in this to relieved some of my stress. It might be trash, not worth to be read by anyone. Every articles solely based on my opinion and perspective on seeing things. It could be treat as diary? I'm not sure either. Some of them may offended you, some may inspired you. Well, I wish the latter for most articles I wrote. If you think that my point of view were rather wrong or a bit harsh, please just ignore it.

Don't be denial about it, otherwise you'll angry or felt hatred toward me. That isn't very healthy for your mental stability. After all, most of articles I wrote were the fruits of my stress. Of course, you would find it kind of trashy or maybe controversial.

Let me remind you once more. Most of my articles are very personal.

I believe:

*With the time goes on, I'll gain new experiences, knowledge and new perspective. When that time come, I'll be embarrassed for writing all of these.*

That's what I called **personal development**. You don't need to dictate me or push me. I'll be able to correct myself eventually.
