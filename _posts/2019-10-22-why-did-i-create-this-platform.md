 As I mentioned in [previous article]({{site.url}}/introduction-about-me/), I am an introverted person. When interacting with people, I tend to be socially awkward. I always hesitate in giving a response in some situations, which has an effect on how I do facial expression. I did this because I’m not sure if I offended someone or not, so I had to be extremely cautious when I was having social interaction.

This personality trait makes me look like an unapproachable person. Although I have this barrier, I always try so hard to be as friendly as possible. I also do my job perfectly to avoid others getting in trouble because of me. But unfortunately people seem to leave it unnoticed because of these barriers. To be honest, it was frustrating to know that you tried so hard to not make mistakes but everyone just ignored your efforts.

> The problem with doing things well, is that it's invisible. What's visible is mistakes. So then you just work really hard and you're invisible. That's not helpful.\

Up until recently, I realized that I’ve been documenting people's works, but never recorded my own. Let alone communicating it to others. The very reason I made this website was to create digital footprints on what I’m doing by compiling all projects, ideas, opinions, and also stories in one place. So, I can easily show off my works to others.\
In doing so, writing skills play an important role in producing great digital footprints. Within all of my experiences, writing wasn't my kind of thing. To find a topic is quite easy, but to put it in structural words is a whole different story. I needed a lot of effort to create one article. And I usually spend my time reviewing my writings at least three to four times. I am aware that this is inconvenient.\
Through this platform, not only did I get a digital footprint of my projects, I’m hoping that I can improve my writing skills. I also want to improve my vocabulary in English. So, I tried to write all articles in English. This platform will consist of my project documentations and articles.

I provided detailed processing steps and data sources in most projects I did. If you can understand my projects, you may duplicate its steps to your own.

As for the articles, well… Every article is solely based on my opinion and perspective on seeing things. So, it is ***very personal***. You might or might not be offended by my point of view. _Please forgive me for my ignorance and just ignore it_. After all, my purpose of writing the articles was just to sort out my thoughts and relieve my stress, it’s natural if my perspectives are wrong.

I believe that:\
As time goes on, I'll gain new experiences, knowledge and new perspectives. When that time comes, I'll be embarrassed to write all of these.

That's what I called __personal development__ and I am eager to wait for those opportunities to come to me.
